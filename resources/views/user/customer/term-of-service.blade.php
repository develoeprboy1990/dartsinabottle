    <li>ii. BORROWED darts (the barrels you have previously received from other users LENT darts and returned to us)</li>
</ul>
LENT darts must be tungsten barrels. We do not accept barrels of any other material or metal.</p>

    <b style="text-decoration: underline;">USE</b><br>
You shall use our website to connect with people who will send their own LENT darts in, and these darts will be shared with other users.<br>
WE DO NOT PROVIDE WHOLE SETS OF DARTS. WE ONLY PROVIDE THE BARRELS. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY FLIGHTS OR STEMS FROM THE US, ONLY THE BARRELS.
